                                Hello! I'm Dant√° Kelly, a passionate and driven full-stack web developer based in Jamaica. My 
                                journey in coding began in 2023, when I took the first step towards turning my interest into a 
                                career. With dedication and perseverance, I taught myself how to code through online courses 
                                and self-study.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through trial and error, I honed my skills and continued to push beyond my limits. My passion
                                for web development grows stronger with each project I complete, and I'm excited to bring
                                my skills and creativity to help clients achieve their online goals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I'm proficient in a
                                range of programming languages and technologies. I'm committed to staying up-to-date with
                                industry trends and best practices, ensuring that my skills remain current and in-demand.
                            </p>
